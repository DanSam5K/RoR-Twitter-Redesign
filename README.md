# RoR-Twitter-Redesign Capstone Project

This project was intended to put my knowledge of Ruby on Rails module into practice through the Twitter-Redesign app that allows user to login, view homepage/tweets, suggestion on who to follow, access their user profile and those of others, and creating tweets.

I had the option to personalise the website and style it my own way. The end goal however was to create anything that someone could share opinions about with people who follow them and vice versa. The design I have emulated is by Design idea by [Gregoire Vella on Behance](https://www.behance.net/gregoirevella).
